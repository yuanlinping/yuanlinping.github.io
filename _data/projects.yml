  description: We created a type of dancing 3D text that could be displayed in different environments with various visual effects based on physically based rendering. We also implemented two kinds of animations in which a text mesh deforms to a sphere and a spiral, respectively.

- title: Ordering System
  article: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_35153254/category_7224290.html?spm=1001.2014.3001.5482
  description: I developed an ordering system for canteens in C++ with the framework Qt during my internship in a startup. The system involved many modules such as database, network, Bluetooth, and printer. The GUI was iteratively designed and developed, which was much better than the shown figure. Sadly, I cannot find the final version.
